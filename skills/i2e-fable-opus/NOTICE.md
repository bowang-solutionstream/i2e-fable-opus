# Provenance and upstream notices

## Primary upstream credit: Addy Osmani

Credit to Addy Osmani's [agent-skills](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills)
for the foundational engineering skillset behind this workflow's adapted planning,
incremental implementation, testing, source-driven development, and review guidance.
This package consolidates those practices with the locally authored Issue-to-Edit
orchestration and Fable/Opus routing. It is an independent adaptation, not an
official release of the upstream skillset or a claim of upstream endorsement.

## Package provenance and retained licenses

This Claude Code package was adapted on 2026-09-28 from
[i2e-astra-terra](https://github.com/bowang-solutionstream/i2e-astra-terra), source
revision `1feac0ce92f3d0498ad1dbfcfae0294b9ed081c3`, the Codex package of the same
workflow. The adaptation replaces Astra Ultra / Terra xhigh routing with Fable 5.1
Max / Opus 5.5 Max through bundled Claude Code subagent definitions and installs
into Claude Code's skill and agent directories. Codex-only interface metadata and
the optional `i2e-hybrid` compatibility alias are not carried over. The Codex
package is provenance, not an installation or runtime dependency.

That package was assembled on 2026-09-08 from the locally authored Issue-to-Edit
workflow and hybrid-routing requirements. Its prior package was
`h3ro-dev/issue-to-edit-workflow-skills`. That repository is provenance, not an
installation or runtime dependency.

The standalone instructions consolidate and rewrite the former multi-skill
workflow. Changes include lead/implementer model routing, a shared authority and
acceptance contract, proportional proof, final-state review, and repair escalation.
No credentials, client artifacts, or project-specific deployment configuration are
included.

The engineering and issue-writing guidance draws on practices packaged previously
from the following sources. Attribution and license copies are retained with the
installed skill. Upstream source files are not installed as separate skills.

The original locally authored wrapper names were `i2e-mode`, `issue-workflow-gate`,
`writeissue-guidance`, and `project-coding-guidance`. The new package does not load
them or the legacy hybrid delivery skill. This notice does not imply endorsement
by the upstream authors or change their license terms.
