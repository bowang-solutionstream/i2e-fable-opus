# Verification and independent judgment

Start with the smallest evidence that proves the changed behavior, then satisfy
all applicable repository/issue requirements. Reuse a recorded result only when
its revision, inputs, environment, and relevant dependencies remain valid. New
edits, failures, or unresolved concerns justify reruns; reassurance alone does not.

| Surface | Useful proof |
| --- | --- |
| Documentation/configuration | Diff review; links, format, or schema where relevant |
| Typed implementation | Affected-package typecheck/lint and behavioral tests |
| Bug or new logic | Regression or outcome test; boundary/error cases |
| API/schema | Caller compatibility and integration/contract evidence |
| UI/user flow | Relevant component checks plus actual browser interaction |
| Persistence/migration | Data-preservation, retry/restart and restore evidence |
| Build/CI | Required checks for the exact candidate revision |
| Deployed service | Deployed revision, health/smoke, observed behavior and rollback |

Use the project's commands. Full-suite checks, builds, and browser sweeps are
required when the touched behavior or repository calls for them, not merely after
every edit. Treat external calls as actions with their own authority and cost.

## Failed or missing proof

Diagnose failures in the requested scope and repair them under existing authority.
Record pre-existing failures separately with a baseline where practical; do not
silently waive a required gate. Missing credentials can leave an integration proof
pending while local work continues. If required proof remains unavailable, report
incomplete and specify the missing evidence. Only a real access constraint,
non-waivable gate, or consequential user decision blocks its dependent work.

## Review standard

Assess correctness, omitted requirements, maintainability, architecture, relevant
security boundaries, and runtime efficiency. Inspect the resulting code and test
assertions, not only a worker's summary or pass counts. Revisit the requirements
independently: the implementation and its tests may share a mistaken assumption.

Scale review to risk. The Fable lead can review normal Opus work. Use a fresh
Fable reviewer for consequential or hard-to-reverse changes. Review should identify
concrete failures and necessary repairs; distinguish optional preferences from
blocking defects. Approval means requirements and proof are satisfied with no
unresolved material defect; it does not mean the code is perfect.

The final reviewer reviews the final patch after repairs, reusing still-valid
evidence. A required failed or missing check never becomes a completed task merely
because it was documented accurately. A completed local implementation can still
have an explicitly separate, unrequested deployment phase.
